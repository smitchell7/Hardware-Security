% write about the auth() function and the UART buffer check disable

As part of the preparation for the ROP implementation, we disabled some  optimizations in order to simplify the attack. The compiler flag -O0 was used instead of -O2, which made the assembly code more readable. Another compiler flag, --no\_protect\_stack, was used to remove canaries which alert the program when the stack is corrupted. The linker flag, --no\_remove, ensured that the included libraries were flashed to the board even if the code wasn't executed. This doubled our available code space, which allowed for more precise selection of gadgets.
