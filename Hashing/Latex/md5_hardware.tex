Overview and objectives; details of implementation.  Include architecture diagram.  Discuss benchmark procedure.  Ways to improve performance and/or discussion of how higher performance could be achieved.  Performance is dependent on implementation (GPU vs.\ FPGA).  FPGA or GPU details (cores, gates, clock, etc).  Use a table, if need be.
